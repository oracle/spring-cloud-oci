== Common application properties

include::_attributes.adoc[]

Various properties can be specified inside your `application.properties` file, inside your `application.yml` file, or as command line switches.
This appendix provides a list of common {project-full-name} properties and references to the underlying classes that consume them.

NOTE: Property contributions can come from additional jar files on your classpath, so you should not consider this an exhaustive list.
Also, you can define your own properties.
